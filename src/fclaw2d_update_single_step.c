   Advance the level using a single explicit time step
   Assumption is that the call back function 'cb_single_step'
   can update each patch independently of all the other
   patches at the level.  A second assumption is that only
   boundary conditions at the the current patch time are
   needed.  These are set before entering the patch update
   routine.

   This function is analogous to the MOL step solver
   fclaw_mol_step.cpp in that upon return, all the patches at
   the given level have been updated at the new time.
